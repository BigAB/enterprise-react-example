🏢 Enterprise Corp™

## The problem

Enterprise Corp is not attracting enough React consulting opportunities. Enterprise Corp has been doing React consulting, but we have no way of distinguishing ourselves from our competitors.

## Goals

- Establish ourselves as **React experts** in the developer community and with our clients
  - experts who can build and release scalable and maintainable React apps
  - experts who can help our clients release scalable and maintainable React apps
- Generate **Qualified Sales Leads** (QSLs) for React projects and React related sales

## The solution

A collection of React focused initiatives directed at achieving the stated goals: **Establishing ourselves as experts** and **generating QSLs**.

> **Terms and Definitions used in this document**
>
> **Strategies**: An overall method of achieving our stated Goals  
> **Initiatives**: A collection of related projects and tasks that utilize strategies.  
> **Projects**: A collection of team members and tasks to be done in order to accomplish our goals  
> **Tasks**: An effort to be completed, usually assigned to a person or team as part of a project

The general **strategies** to achieving the goals are:

- Marketing: increase visibility in the developer community
- Delivery: get recognized for doing amazing work on our client projects
- Community: create a thriving community of engaged developers on our community slack

Our **Marketing** strategy will help establish ourselves as React Experts in the developer community and open a wider net of sales prospects on social media from shared content.

Our **Delivery** strategy will help establish ourselves as React Experts with our clients, and likely lead to QSLs by word of mouth.

Our **Community** strategy is to create a closer relationship to a connected group of sales prospects and possibly generate QSLs from people who already trust us, know we are experts, and likely have already been assisted or impressed by us before

There are 3 main initiatives at this time are:

### The Training Initiative

We will create React training curriculum and content in various forms including, but not limited to, documentation, videos, guides, demo apps, exercises, and workshops all related to learning React and how to build large scale apps with React.

We will also use this material internally to ensure we always have enough React experts to take on client React projects, increase the React expertise at Enterprise Corp, and ensure we are able to complete React projects on time and under budget. `(Delivery)`

We will offer continuing development in React and React application development related skills to make sure our development process is modern and efficient. `(Delivery)`

We also create online training material, such as guides and videos for the Enterprise Corp YouTube channel, egghead.io, Frontend Masters, etc. These will serve to increase our visibility in the developer community, establish ourselves as experts and be used as a vehicle to invite developers to our Enterprise Corp community. `(Marketing, Community)`

In addition, we will offer a **live workshop** training service to clients who have front-end teams in place, that want to improve their skills with React and creating React applications. `(Delivery)`

### The Outreach Inititiave

We will create blog posts, videos, and social media content about using React, new React tools, interesting patterns and techniques around building apps with React. This will serve to establish ourselves as experts in React and to have the name Enterprise Corp recognized as a source for React expertise. `(Marketing, Community)`

We will speak or run workshops at conferences, speak as guests on podcasts or any other developer platform about React and React related topics to both network with possible prospects as well as establish ourselves as experts. `(Marketing, Community)`

We will engage in traditional digital marketing methods such as increasing the SEO value of our React Services landing page, engage in influencer marketing and social media, campaign marketing or any other Brand Awareness tasks that will help establish us as experts and remove any friction from turning prospects into QSLs. `(Marketing)`

We will maintain an Enterprise Corp community Discord channel and/or forum, where we will track and engage with community members. We wll assist community members with the use of our tools, gather feedback about our projects, promote and celebrate community member's contributions and look for high quality members which could be recruited to the Enterprise Corp team. `(Community)`

We will try and leverage satisfied clients to create testimonials and endorsements to be used in our marketing material. `(Marketing)`

### The Tools Initiative

We will create high quality tools, components, and libraries that will help developers create scalable and maintainable React applications.

We will use these tools on our consultinig client projects where applicable. `(Delivery)`

We will promote these tools in the general React community to help us establish ourselves as experts and possibly generate QSLs from companies that use the tools on their projects. `(Marketing, Community)`

We will use the main site of these projects (GitHub Readme.md or whatever) to promote Enterprise Corp and offer support at the Enterprise Corp community slack/forum. `(Marketing, Community)`
